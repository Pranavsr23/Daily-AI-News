    <p class="description">Ring has launched a new Ring Verify tool that the company says can &quot;verify that Ring videos you receive haven&#x27;t been edited or changed.&quot; But since Ring won&#x27;t verify videos that have been altered in any way, it probably won&#x27;t be able to verify those videos you…</p>
